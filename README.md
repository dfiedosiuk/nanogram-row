# Nanogram row

### Program is inspired by nonogram puzzles.
It takes the binary array consisting of only the values 0 and 1. 
Given a binary array of any length, return an array of positive integers 
that represent the lengths of the sets of consecutive 1's in the input array, in order from left to right.

For example:
* [1,1,1,1,1] gives [5]
* [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1] gives [5,4]
* [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1] gives [2,1,3]
